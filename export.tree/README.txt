# Subjects / Participants
The participants.tsv file contains subject IDs with demographic informations as well as an inventory of the scans that are included for each subject.

# Dataset Derivatives (/derivatives)
The /derivaties folder contains summary information that reflects the data and its contents:

# T1w Anatomical
Defacing was performed using freesurfer mri_deface (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mri_deface)

# PAMenc / PAMret
The larger amount of missing PAM scans is due to a task design change early in the study. It was decided that data collected before the design change would be excluded.

# Stop Signal
The Stop Signal task consisted of both a training task (no MRI) and the in-scanner fMRI task. The data from the training run is included in each subject's beh folder with the task name "stopsignaltraining".

# Known Issues:
Some of the T1-weighted images included within this dataset (around 20%) show an aliasing artifact potentially generated by a headset. The artifact renders as a ghost that may overlap the cortex through one or both temporal lobes. A list of participants showing the artifact has been added to the dataset.
