1. Sample Preparation
l Brain tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).
l Before MRI scanning, samples were immersed in a 0.2 mM gadolinium-containing 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS PH: 7.4) for at least one week.
l During MRI measurements, samples were immersed in Fluorinert (Sumitomo 3M Limited, Tokyo, Japan) to minimize background signal.
2. MRI Scanners and Coil Selection
a. For Small to Medium-sized Brains
l Scanner: 7T MRI scanner (BioSpec 70/16, Bruker Biospin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany)
l Gradient System: Actively shielded gradients with a maximum strength of 700 mT/m
l Coils:
O Volume coils: φ 22 mm, 38 mm, 62 mm, and 72 mm (Bruker Biospin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany)
	O Solenoid coils: φ 16 mm and 30 mm (Takashima Seisakusho, Tokyo, Japan)
Coil selection was based on sample size.
b. For Large Brains (e.g., bamboo mouse)
l Scanner: 3T Philips MRI scanner (Ingenia, Philips, Netherlands)
l Coil: 32-channel head coil
